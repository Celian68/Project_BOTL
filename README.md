Description:
------------
BOTL is a real-time strategy game inspired by classics such as Age of War and Clan Wars: Goblin Forest.

Features:
---------
- Real-Time Strategy: Command your units, hero, and buildings against an opposing team.
- Unit Diversity: Manage various units with unique abilities and upgrades.
- Customizable Heroes: Choose and upgrade your hero, a key element on the battlefield.
- Dynamic Spells: Cast a variety of spells with multiple effects (damage, push, healing, etc.) that influence the battle.
- Building Upgrades: Enhance your castle and buildings to improve resource generation and defense.
